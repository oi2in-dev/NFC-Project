# NFC-Project
This is a Project/Investigation of NFC, RFID, and NDEC devices.

My goal is to create a cross-platform App that can read, write and emulate the signal of these devices.

I will then use this App to conduct research into how secure these chips/signals actually are, 
by investigating how to break the signals down to binary and reverse engineering them to 
see if free or elevated access is granted on a premises for example.

Due to the Nature of the vulnerabilities that I will potentially discover, some aspects of this project can 
not be open-source. However, all relevant information will be passed on to the relevant organizations.
